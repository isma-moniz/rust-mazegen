# rust-mazegen

This is a simple maze generator written in Rust. It uses recursive backtracking and bit encoding to represent the walls.

## Running the program

```
cargo run <size>
```

where <size> is the length of the sides of the maze. 

## Future updates

- SDL2 integration
- Implementing a solver
- Allowing the choice of different generation/solving algorithms
